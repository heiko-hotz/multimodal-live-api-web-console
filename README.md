# Multimodal Live API - Web console

This repository contains a react-based starter app for using the [Multimodal Live API](<[https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api](https://ai.google.dev/api/multimodal-live)>) over a websocket. It provides modules for streaming audio playback, recording user media such as from a microphone, webcam or screen capture as well as a unified log view to aid in development of your application.

Watch the demo of the Multimodal Live API [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_q7JY1XxFE).

## Usage

To get started, [create a free Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and add it to the `.env` file. Then:

```
$ npm install && npm start
```

We have provided several example applications on other branches of this repository:

- [demos/GenExplainer](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console/tree/demos/genexplainer)
- [demos/GenWeather](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console/tree/demos/genweather)
- [demos/GenList](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console/tree/demos/genlist)

## Example

Below is an example of an entire application that will use Google Search grounding and then render graphs using [vega-embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed):

```typescript
import { type FunctionDeclaration, SchemaType } from "@google/generative-ai";
import { useEffect, useRef, useState, memo } from "react";
import vegaEmbed from "vega-embed";
import { useLiveAPIContext } from "../../contexts/LiveAPIContext";

export const declaration: FunctionDeclaration = {
  name: "render_altair",
  description: "Displays an altair graph in json format.",
  parameters: {
    type: SchemaType.OBJECT,
    properties: {
      json_graph: {
        type: SchemaType.STRING,
        description:
          "JSON STRING representation of the graph to render. Must be a string, not a json object",
      },
    },
    required: ["json_graph"],
  },
};

export function Altair() {
  const [jsonString, setJSONString] = useState<string>("");
  const { client, setConfig } = useLiveAPIContext();

  useEffect(() => {
    setConfig({
      model: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
      systemInstruction: {
        parts: [
          {
            text: 'You are my helpful assistant. Any time I ask you for a graph call the "render_altair" function I have provided you. Dont ask for additional information just make your best judgement.',
          },
        ],
      },
      tools: [{ googleSearch: {} }, { functionDeclarations: [declaration] }],
    });
  }, [setConfig]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const onToolCall = (toolCall: ToolCall) => {
      console.log(`got toolcall`, toolCall);
      const fc = toolCall.functionCalls.find(
        (fc) => fc.name === declaration.name
      );
      if (fc) {
        const str = (fc.args as any).json_graph;
        setJSONString(str);
      }
    };
    client.on("toolcall", onToolCall);
    return () => {
      client.off("toolcall", onToolCall);
    };
  }, [client]);

  const embedRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (embedRef.current && jsonString) {
      vegaEmbed(embedRef.current, JSON.parse(jsonString));
    }
  }, [embedRef, jsonString]);
  return <div className="vega-embed" ref={embedRef} />;
}
```

## development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Project consists of:

- an Event-emitting websocket-client to ease communication between the websocket and the front-end
- communication layer for processing audio in and out
- a boilerplate view for starting to build your apps and view logs

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Vertex AI Integration

This fork modifies the original application to work with Google Cloud's Vertex AI endpoint instead of the public Gemini API. The main changes include:

### Key Changes

1. **Proxy Server**
   - Added a Python-based WebSocket proxy (`backend/proxy.py`) to handle authentication and routing between the client and Vertex AI
   - The proxy manages bearer token authentication and forwards messages bidirectionally

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - Removed API key authentication
   - Added bearer token and project ID inputs in the UI
   - Bearer token can be obtained using `gcloud auth print-access-token`

3. **Configuration Updates**
   - Modified model path to use Vertex AI format: `projects/{projectId}/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp`
   - Updated WebSocket endpoint to use Vertex AI: `us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com`

### Setup Instructions

1. Start the proxy server:
```bash
python backend/proxy.py
```

2. Set environment variable for the proxy URL (defaults to ws://localhost:8080):
```bash
export REACT_APP_PROXY_URL=ws://localhost:8080
```

3. Get your bearer token:
```bash
gcloud auth print-access-token
```

4. Start the React application:
```bash
npm start
```

5. In the UI:
   - Enter your Google Cloud Project ID
   - Paste your bearer token
   - Connect to start using the application

### Technical Details

The main modifications were made to these files:

1. **App.tsx**
   - Added form inputs for bearer token and project ID
   - Updated LiveAPIProvider to use proxy configuration

2. **LiveAPIContext.tsx**
   - Modified provider props to accept bearer token and project ID
   - Removed API key requirement

3. **use-live-api.ts**
   - Updated authentication flow to use bearer token
   - Added project ID handling for model paths
   - Enhanced audio handling and logging

4. **multimodal-live-client.ts**
   - Modified WebSocket connection logic to work with proxy
   - Updated message handling for Vertex AI responses
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

These changes allow the application to work with enterprise Vertex AI deployments while maintaining the original functionality of the application.
